# CUMC_Data_Science_Group

Fall 2017

Our goal is to learn data science, either using biomedical data sets or other open data. While this seems a large undertaking, this group will give the necessary structure, planning, motivation and support for learning more about and working within this field. This group is for all those interested or working with data to address questions and hypotheses. Our study approach consists of two parts: 

* Structured Learning

* Projects

    In Structured Learning, we are going through the videos in the courses of the Data Science Specialization on Coursera to expose people to R and basics for completing a project.
    
    The Project will be devised by a group of people towards a common end goal. The objective is to learn but the end "product" would be something that anyone can view or read, and will be put in this repository.
